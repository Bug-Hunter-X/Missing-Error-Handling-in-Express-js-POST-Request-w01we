# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for data validation in POST requests.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of a vulnerable endpoint that doesn't handle invalid or missing user data.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The primary issue is the absence of validation and error handling for the incoming request body (`req.body`). If a client sends malformed or incomplete data, the server might crash or produce unexpected outputs.  Currently, the server only logs the received data and responds with a 201 status code regardless of the data's validity.

## Solution

The solution involves adding validation logic to verify the request body's structure and content.  Appropriate error handling is implemented to return informative error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) when validation fails.  This prevents server-side crashes and enhances the application's robustness and security.  Detailed error messages in the responses can aid developers in debugging client-side issues.
